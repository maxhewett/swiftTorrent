# swiftTorrent

### swiftTorrent is a torrent application for macOS written (mostly) in Swift that has Sonarr & Radarr integration. 

It's distinguishing features are: 

* it doesn't look ugly
* it has cool animations
* it auto moves completed downloads based on category
* it hides the lengthy torrent names i.e. "The.Room.2003.xX-ligmaman-Xx.BRRIP.h265.rePACK" in favour of proper titles like "The Room (2009)" and movie/tv show posters.

It is focussed mostly on Movie & TV Show downloads via its integration with Trakt and tvdb.
